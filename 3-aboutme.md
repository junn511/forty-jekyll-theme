<p>I am a researcher, interaction designer especially focusing on eye gaze interaction.
<br>
One of my research topic is eyewear computing. we’re collaborating eye glasses company called JIN Co.,LTD and made eye wear device J!NS MEME. It has three electrodes embodied glasses and that enable to measure such as eye movement , head posture. I’m exploring the possibilities of some new user interface and understand human activity using this device.
